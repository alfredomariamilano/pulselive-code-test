# Pulselive Front End Task
## Alfredo Maria Milano

### Installation:
Unzip the file and through your terminal browse to the unzipped folder. From within that folder, you can run  the command ```npm i```, which will install all the Node packages necessary and after that will run automatically a Gulp task to convert and minify the code to be served in the distributable folder called public, created ad hoc.
####Note:
Both NodeJS and npm are required to be installed globally in the user's computer to be able to run these commands.

### Use:
Using your browser of choice, go to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). The app gets the data from the backend through an http request and builds the first card on landing. The user can then select a different player from a dropdown menu to check his stats.
